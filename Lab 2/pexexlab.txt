I start with "gdb ~eggert/bin64/bin/emacs-24.5" to open the debug tool

"set args -batch -eval '(print (* 6997 -4398042316799 179))'" to set the argument for the emacs program

"break Ftimes" to place a breakpoint at function Ftimes

"Run" to start running the emacs program.

"disas Ftimes" to show the assembly language of the Ftimes function.

"disas arith_driver" to show the assembly language of the arith_driver function.

I use "stepi" to execute instructions one by one.

"p/a" to display values in registers

"x/g" to display values in memory
