//B. not true because (x-y) may underflow that is, x is negative number and y is positive number,
//when subtract y from x, it might result big negative number that int cannot represent.

//C. true because although doubles are having precision rounding errors, but they can represent int accurately, so it true.

//D. not true because the result of first multiplication can be large and doubles are not associative, rounding errors cause errors.
